# Basic-calculator

Project 02 to do: Develop a Calculator
Objective:
Now as you are familiar with JavaScript commands, Create a basic calculator app that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator should have a user-friendly interface with a display area and buttons for digits and operations.

Requirements:
HTML Structure:
Create an HTML file with a display area and buttons for digits (0-9) and basic operations (+, -, \*, /).
Use CSS to style the calculator for a clean and visually appealing layout.

JavaScript Functionality:
Implement JavaScript to handle button clicks and updating the display.
Ensure that the calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Include a 'C' button to clear the display if needed

Calculation and Display:
When the user clicks an operator button, the calculator should store the current value and wait for the next input.
When the user clicks the '=' button, calculate and display the result.
Handle division by zero and display an error message if necessary.
